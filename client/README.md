## Instructions
- This project has to screens called `Login` and `Board` under `pages` folder. The `Login` was implemented, the `Board` is empty (besides an app bar)
- The project has some code standards that we implemented - you can rely on this standard or use your own
- We used `css-modules` for styling the code - but you can choose whatever you're familiar with (`MUI`, `tailwind-css`, `SCSS`, pure `CSS`, etc)
- The design is yours to choose
- When the user logs in successfully - we store it in the local storage so it won't have to login again everytime (we also provided a logout button for loggin out).
- The are some implemented hooks, components, api requests and utils - you can use whatever you wish from them
